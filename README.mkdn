# Project-Sakura build script #

### Description ###

This bash script is used to build ProjectSakura and upload via FTP.  
With proper settings, it's also possible to push to SourceForge automatically.

### How to Install

In order to install this, all it's needed to be done is copy build script locally, set it as executable and configure it with built-in wizard.  
To do so run following commands in terminal:

```bash
# Download the script with curl
$ curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProjectSakura/build_script/10/build
# Make script executable
$ chmod +x build
# run the script
$ . build (for the first time only)
```

### Configuration

You now need to configure build script and add device codenames that you want to build for.  
For that just issue **./build** in terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

```bash
$ ./build
$ Please enter the path where Sakura folder is located (full path ex:/home/<user>/<folder-name>)
$ /home/user/sakura
$ Upload compilation to remote server at end of build?
$ 1 or 2 (Yes/No)
$ Enter remote hostname (ex: sourceforge):
$ frs.sourceforge.net
$ Enter remote username::
$ user
$ Enter remote password:
$ myultrasecurepassword
```

Now as you just set your configuration, next step would be to add a devices to initiate build for.  
Running **./build add** will prompt you to enter your device information.  

```bash
$ ./build add
$ Add a new device:
$ Format: <device codename>,<remote upload path>
$ X00T
```


### Additional stuff (optional and not mandatory)

If you want for example to repopick some unmerged commits, just create a repopick.txt file, and add your stuff there.  
Build script will execute them after repo sync
